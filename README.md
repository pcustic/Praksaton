# Praksaton
Project made for university course called Racunarski praktikum 2 (web programming, PHP + JS).

To run the application you should adjust database settings in model/db.class.php and first run script app/boot/prepare_DB.php. That script creates database tables and fills database with a bit of data.

Application is written in PHP following MVC "PHPRO" design pattern.

This is Praksaton, web application for student internships. Everybody can view offered internships, students can register, edit their profile and apply to internships.

Companies can register, offer new internship and accept/reject students that applied to their internships.

App is in Croatian.

You can (maybe) find app [here](http://rp2.studenti.math.hr/~pcustic/mvc/projekt).
